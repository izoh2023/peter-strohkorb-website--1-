                <h2>Setting The Scene…</h2>
                <p>
                  Simon Washington, the Global CEO of AMAG, a leading technology and services company with teams in
                  Australia, New Zealand and the USA, faced a daunting challenge. His sales organization was struggling.
                  Sales cycles dragged on for months, deals were getting stuck in the pipeline, and the lack of cohesion
                  among his teams was a roadblock to growth. Each sales rep operated with their own processes, value
                  propositions and engagement strategies.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-primary">
                  It was an inconsistent chaos. Simon knew something had to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His business was at risk of stagnation, and the pressure was mounting. Then, a trusted contact
                  recommended he speak with me, Peter Strohkorb, to explore how my Buyer-Friendly Selling System could
                  help fast-track his pipeline and close deals quicker. Simon had heard about the success others had
                  achieved with this approach, but this was his time — his call to action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At first, Simon hesitated. After all, his team was spread across three countries, each with their own
                  dynamics, and he wondered if one system could truly bring them together. Could it really shorten sales
                  cycles, bring consistency, and create the alignment they desperately needed?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The thought of disrupting the entire sales organization for a new approach was daunting. But deep
                  down, Simon knew that if he didn’t act soon, the problem would only worsen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After some reflection, Simon decided to take the leap. He reached out to me to explore implementing
                  the Buyer-Friendly Selling System across his global sales team. We discussed the importance of
                  aligning the entire team around a common sales strategy — one that would no longer focus on selling
                  solutions, but on understanding buyer needs and helping them to fast-track their buying process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simon was ready for the transformation his business needed and agreed to work with me and took a bold
                  step forward.

                <h2>1. When We First Met…</h2>
                <p>
                  He convened his entire sales team from Australia, New Zealand, and the USA into Brisbane, Australia,
                  for a one-week intensive product, services, solutions, and sales workshop. This would be the start of
                  a new chapter for AMAG — but it wouldn’t be easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we first met the team, it was clear that they were fragmented, operating in silos with different
                  approaches to value propositions and engagement strategies. Each salesperson was fending for
                  themselves, and there was no cohesion, no unified system driving the team forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team faced significant internal challenges. Each rep had their own ideas about how to sell, and
                  none of them had a clear or consistent approach. There was skepticism and uncertainty about whether a
                  unified system could truly work across three distinct markets.
                </p>
                <p>But this is where the real work began.</p>

                <h2>2. What We Did Together…</h2>
                <p>
                  During the workshop, we spent an entire day refining their approach. We worked on developing a
                  structured, scalable, and repeatable selling system that would bring certainty and predictability into
                  their sales process. The system wasn’t just about selling — it was about understanding the buyer’s
                  journey, creating alignment, and aligning the team through a consistent and scalable sales approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Simon and his team, this was their ordeal — the moment of truth. It wasn’t easy for them to let go
                  of their individual processes and embrace a new way of working. They had to trust the system and each
                  other. But as they began to see the power of the Buyer-Friendly Selling System, something incredible
                  started to happen. The team that once operated in silos began to align. They understood the value of a
                  system that focused not on what they wanted to sell, but on what the buyer needed.

                <h2>3. What Changed…</h2>
                <p>
                  Shortly after the workshop, Simon and his team began to see results. Sales cycles that once took two
                  months were being completed in just two weeks. The system had delivered on its promise, and Simon was
                  astounded by the speed and consistency of the results.

                <p>
                  The team was no longer working in disjointed isolation. They were united, empowered by a system that
                  gave them structure and predictability. Buyers responded to the improved engagement. The reward wasn’t
                  just faster sales cycles; it was the alignment and success of a global team working toward a common
                  goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this newfound success, Simon’s business began to thrive. The Buyer-Friendly Selling System had
                  not only shortened sales cycles but also revitalized his team. They had a clear roadmap for success
                  and a renewed sense of purpose. The road back wasn’t just about hitting quotas — it was about building
                  long-term relationships with buyers by focusing on their needs and delivering consistent, value-driven
                  outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through this transformation, Simon had emerged as a leader who had not only saved his company from
                  stagnation but had positioned it for long-term success. He had learned that the key to fast-tracking
                  sales wasn’t just about pushing products and services - it was about truly understanding what buyers
                  needed and aligning his team around delivering that value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, Simon and his team had a scalable, buyer-friendly system that would continue to drive their
                  success well into the future. The team was no longer just a collection of individual sellers; they
                  were a united force, empowered by a system that would bring consistent results across borders and
                  industries. Simon’s journey had transformed not only his sales team but also his company’s future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so, Simon Washington returned to his leadership role with a powerful new tool: the Buyer-Friendly
                  Selling System, which not only fast-tracked his sales but redefined his team’s new-found success.
